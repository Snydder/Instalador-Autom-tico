## [Auto-Installer](https://github.com/matheusperches/Auto-Installer)

#### An auto installer using C# that takes a list of programs and executes them in an specified order.

#### Main features & Background
This program was created with the purpose of replacing an old and broken app used by the Infra team at one of the companies I worked with. I created it to speed up our process and have something we could fix ourselves in case it broke down. 

It includes:

- A list of program paths that can be re-ordered, selected and deselected.

- An easy to use UI

- Basic command line support for app intialization arguments during the installation process.

#### Learnings
- Practiced my C# Skills

- UI creation using Visual Studio 

- Implemented a modular approach to the code where parts were independent, to the best of my ability at the time. 

- Learned how to serialize and de-serialize XML files. 

#### Room for improvement
- Code readability

# Made with dedication, for our team.
